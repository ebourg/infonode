/**
 * A property map contains values for some or all properties in a {@link PropertyMapGroup}. A property map
 * can have any number of super maps from which property values are inherited. Super maps that are searched for
 * values in the reverse order they were added to the property map. Property values are always set in the property
 * map specified.
 * <p>
 * Properties of type {@link PropertyMapProperty} in the {@link PropertyMapGroup} will automatically be assigned
 * new PropertyMap's as values. These PropertyMap's are called child maps. These property values cannot be
 * modified.
 * <p>
 * Listeners can be added to a PropertyMap. The listeners are notified when a property value is modified in the
 * PropertyMap or, if the property value is not overridden, one of it's super maps. A tree listener can also
 * be added that listens for value changes in the property map, it's super maps and it's child mapss.
 * <p>
 * Property maps are created using the factory methods in {@link PropertyMapFactory}.
